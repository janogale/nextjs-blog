If you've never used [Git](https://opensource.com/resources/what-is-git), you may be nervous about it. There's nothing to worry about---just follow along with this step-by-step getting-started guide, and you will soon have a new Git repository hosted on [GitHub](https://opensource.com/life/15/11/short-introduction-github).

Before we dive in, let's clear up a common misconception: Git isn't the same thing as GitHub. Git is a version-control system (i.e., a piece of software) that helps you keep track of your computer programs and files and the changes that are made to them over time. It also allows you to collaborate with your peers on a program, code, or file. GitHub and similar services (including GitLab and BitBucket) are websites that host a Git server program to hold your code.

## Step 1: Create a GitHub account

---

The easiest way to get started is to create an account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) (it's free).

Pick a username (e.g., octocat123), enter your email address and a password, and click **Sign up for GitHub**. Once you are in, it will look something like this:

## Step 2: Create a new repository

---

A repository is like a place or a container where something is stored; in this case we're creating a Git repository to store code. To create a new repository, select **New Repository** from the `+` sign dropdown menu (you can see I've selected it in the upper-right corner in the image above).

Enter a name for your repository (e.g, "Demo") and click **Create Repository**. Don't worry about changing any other options on this page.

Congratulations! You have set up your first repo on GitHub.com.

## Step 3: Create a file

---

Once your repo is created, it will look like this:

Don't panic, it's simpler than it looks. Stay with me. Look at the section that starts "...or create a new repository on the command line," and ignore the rest for now.

Open the *Terminal* program on your computer.
